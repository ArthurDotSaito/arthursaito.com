We've reached that time of the year when I start to think, "Wow, the year is ending," and many people begin to plan their objectives and achievements for the next year. Although I'm uncertain about what I want to do in the upcoming year, it might be insightful to list some events or experiences that occurred this year, which have brought me to my current position. One of the many reasons that drove me to build this website is to 'put things on paper (or on a screen, in this case)', primarily because it helps me to sort out my thoughts.

## Personal

I don't have precise statistics, as I'm not one to meticulously track every habit or achievement throughout the week. However, in a broader sense, here's where I stand so far this year:

- Books: I've read 13 books this year, many of which are technical, like 'Refactoring' by Martin Fowler.
- Travels: I've traveled to three different countries this year: Ecuador, the USA, and Argentina. I visited 27 new cities, with the trip to Gramado being a highlight.
- Sports or Gym: I always enjoy being active. I'm quite proud of my 177 check-ins at Gympass just this year and the time spent playing basketball games.
- Podcasts: I spent 7,233 minutes, or approximately 120 hours and 33 minutes, listening to podcasts. I mostly listen to them while working, driving, or even at the gym. Highlights include Hipsters.tech, Lex Friedman Podcast, Nerdcast, Naruhodo, and Science Vs.

## Career

This year was a game changer in my career. I made the decisive move to step away from industrial engineering, driven by a multitude of reasons. Notably, my increasing immersion in software engineering played a crucial role. Throughout my professional journey, shifting across different fields has become a second nature to me. However, after years of such diversity in my work, I've felt a growing urge to devote more time to my personal projects and life, all of which are intricately linked to the computer science field. There was a moment when my life seemed merely an extension of my work, and so I decided to change the things a little bit and “integrate” my work into my life as one of its many aspects.
