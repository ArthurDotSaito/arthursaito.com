import { Paragraph } from '@/components/Paragraph';

export default function Notes() {

    <Box mb={14}>
      <Paragraph>
        I refer to this section as "notes" because the stuff here is not as well-structured as article. To be honest,
        most of the content consists of simply notes from my Notion account.
      </Paragraph>
    </Box>
  );
