I love this part of the year, after all a new year is a new beginning, right?

It's now a tradition: every year I try to list the things I've done, this is a reminder to identify what decisions worked well and what was a disaster. For me, it's also the time to ask myself: "Where do I wanna get in my career?" and after some thought into that comes the second question: "What am I doing right now to achieve that?"
